# Score-Apartment-Recommender

### How to Use the App

#### **Main Page**
1. Provides simple filtering options for specific states, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and price range.
2. Click **"Show Filtered Apartments"** to view apartments matching your criteria.

#### **Score-Based Filtering**
1. In addition to the basic filtering options, you can use two additional features: **Bedroom Rating** and **Bathroom Rating**.
2. These ratings represent flexibility, with lower ratings allowing for more variation in the results.  
   - For example, if a user requires `X` bedrooms but is okay with `X-1` or `X+1` bedrooms (`X+2` or `X-2` may also be included depending on the rating), they can adjust the **Bedroom Rating** accordingly.
3. For a more diverse set of recommendations, users can click on the **"More Recommendations"** option. These additional recommendations are unseen results close to the score-filtered apartments in feature space and provide new suggestions beyond the filtered apartments.

#### **Simple Search Engine**
1. A basic search engine allows users to search for apartments by address or name.
2. The top 5 matching apartments are displayed.

#### **Future Developments**
Currently, only the top 5 results are displayed for valid searches or filters. Future enhancements may include support for paginated results to display more apartments.
